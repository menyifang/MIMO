MIMO is a generalizable model for controllable video synthesis, which can not only synthesize realistic character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by very simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework.
